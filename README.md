These events attract players from all around the world who come to compete in them. As computer technology has blessed us with the ability to mimic the human brain, it has also given us the ability to analyze historical data in order to predict the future. We take use of this chance to forecast player performance, and based on the forecasted performance, we attempt to construct some optimum teams that may be used to assist team owners in forming squads for competitions. We learn how to implement the prediction process using machine learning methods in this article, and we see how multi-objective optimization approaches may help us build optimum squads in a more precise manner by utilizing the predicted performances.
